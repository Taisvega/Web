## **Part One: Solidify Terminology**

In your own terms, define the following terms:

- What is HTTP?
an application layer protocol designed to transfer information between networked devices and runs on top of other layers
- What is a URL?
Uniform Resource Locator
- What is DNS?
Domain Name System, this is a system that takes human-readable URLs and converts them into IP addresses.
- What is a query string?
a part of a uniform resource locator (URL) that assigns values to specified parameters
- What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
- GET - get some data from the server (most pages, search forms)
- POST - send some data to the server (pages that change data on server)
- What is an HTTP request?
made by a client, to a named host, which is located on a server
- What is an HTTP response?
made by a server to a client
- What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
- Headers provide additional information about the request or the response. Here are some examples:
- Request headers: Host, User-Agent, Accept, Cookie, Cache-Control
- Response headers: Content-Type, Last-Modified, Set-Cookie, Cache-Control
- What are the processes that happen when you type “[http://somesite.com/some/page.html](http://somesite.com/some/page.html)” into a browser?
1. Your browser “resolves” the name into an IP address using DNS
2. Your browser makes a request to that IP address, including headers (info about browser, any previous cookies, and other things)
3. The server sends a response typically, HTML, with a status code (200 if it was sucessful)
4. The browser makes a DOM from that HTML, and finds any other resources needed (images, CSS, JavaScript, etc)
5. The browser makes separate HTTP requests for those resources and receives response from the server for each
